# How to Get Your LIVE PayPal Client ID

To receive real money, you need a "Client ID" from PayPal. It is free.

1.  Go to [developer.paypal.com](https://developer.paypal.com) and log in with your normal PayPal account.
2.  Click on **"Apps & Credentials"** in the menu.
3.  Click the toggle button that says **"Live"** (it is usually on "Sandbox" by default).
4.  Click **"Create App"**.
5.  Name it `CardChecker` and click "Create App".
6.  You will see a long code called **Client ID**.
7.  **Copy that Client ID** and paste it into the chat with me.

I will then add it to your website code.
